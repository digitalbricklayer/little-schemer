Little Schemer Exercises
========================

Exercises done whilst reading "The Little Schemer" by Daniel P Friedman.

The book takes the beginning Schemer through a series of exercises gradually building an understanding of the Scheme language. Scheme is a dialect of Lisp, a list based language. Everything in Lisp is a list, including the all data and code. Whilst the language may look difficult, it is indeed quite simple in principal given so few concepts that need to be grasped.
